<!---![Course Logo](course_logo.png) --->

This repository contains my work and assignments from the Coursera "TensorFlow Advanced Techniques Specialization" offered by DeepLearning.AI. This specialization comprises a series of advanced courses on TensorFlow, covering a wide range of topics in deep learning and machine learning.

## Specialization Overview

- **Course 1:** Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions
  - Description: This course focuses on building custom neural network models, layers, and loss functions to address specific machine learning problems.
  - Folder: `C1_custom_models_layers_loss`

- **Course 2:** Custom and Distributed Training
  - Description: This course covers custom training loops and distributed training strategies for scaling up machine learning models.
  - Folder: `C2_custom_distributed_training`

- **Course 3:** Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow
  - Description: This course explores advanced computer vision techniques, including object detection, image segmentation, and more.
  - Folder: `C3_advanced_computer_vision`

- **Course 4:** Generative Deep Learning with TensorFlow
  - Description: This course dives into generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using TensorFlow.
  - Folder: `C4_generative_deep_learning`

## Usage
