# Coursera TensorFlow Advanced Techniques Specialization

<!---![Course Logo](course_logo.png) --->

This repository contains my work and assignments from the Coursera "[TensorFlow Advanced Techniques Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-advanced-techniques)" offered by [DeepLearning.AI](https://deeplearning.ai). This specialization comprises a series of advanced courses on TensorFlow, covering a wide range of topics in deep learning and machine learning.

## Specialization Overview

- **Course 1:** Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions with TensorFlow
  - Description: This course focuses on building custom neural network models, layers, and loss functions to address specific machine learning problems using Functional API from TensorFlow
  - Folder: [`C1_Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions with TensorFlow`](https://github.com/dween46/coursera-TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization/tree/main/C1_Custom%20Models%2C%20Layers%2C%20and%20Loss%20Functions%20with%20TensorFlow)

- **Course 2:** Custom and Distributed Training
  - Description: This course covers custom training loops and distributed training strategies for scaling up machine learning models.
  - Folder: `C2_Custom and Distributed Training with TensorFlow`

- **Course 3:** Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow
  - Description: This course explores advanced computer vision techniques, including object detection, image segmentation, and more.
  - Folder: `C3_Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow`

- **Course 4:** Generative Deep Learning with TensorFlow
  - Description: This course dives into generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using TensorFlow.
  - Folder: `C4_Generative Deep Learning with TensorFlow`

## Usage

Each course folder contains the assignments, projects, and code related to that particular course. You can explore each course's folder to access the course materials and code.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have TensorFlow and other dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to [DeepLearning.AI](https://deeplearning.ai) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) for offering this specialization and providing valuable knowledge in TensorFlow advanced techniques.
